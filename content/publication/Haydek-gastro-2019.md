abstract = "A diverse intestinal microbiome is a fundamental component within a function-ing alimentary system. This loss of abundance and diversity following antibiotic use increasessusceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)is a therapy gaining acceptability as a treatment for recurrent CDI. While some studies haveanalyzed bacterial abundance after FMT, it is unclear if fecal microbiome analyses in diseasestates, like CDI, over-represent free-floating luminal organisms and underestimate adherentmucosal organisms. We performed a prospective observational study and analyzed 16S rRNAdata  from  10  patients  who  underwent  FMT  for  recurrent  CDI  and  measured  microbiotachanges."
