I TA the Ms Bioinformatics capstone class at Georgia Tech

- BIOL7210 Computation Genomics

I also help design and deliver 40+ 2- and 4- workforce development courses.  More information about these courses can be found on the [Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://abil.ihrc.com/Training)'s website.
