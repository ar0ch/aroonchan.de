# Biography

I'm a bioinformatics software developer at  [Seattle Genetics](https://www.seattlegenetics.com/) and Bioinformatics Scientist at the [Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://abil.ihrc.com).  My PhD focused on health and populations genomics in Colombia, South America and the impacts of recent admixture and ancestry on health.  At Seattle Genetics, I develop software and pipelines to enable data-driven development of next-generation cancer therapuetics.  My work with the Applied Bioinformatics Lab (ABiL) involves the development of bioinformatics methods for public health pathogen surveillance, metagenomics and industry research.
