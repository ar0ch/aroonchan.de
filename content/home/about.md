# Biography

I'm a Bioinformatics Engineer at [Color](https://color.com/) and Scientific Advisor at the [Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://abil.ihrc.com).  At Color, I develop software and pipelines for clinical genetic testing and to support the [AllOfUs program](https://allofus.nih.gov/). 

I'm passionate about using computational methods to develop high impact, low-cost healthcare solutions, at scale; and increasing representation of minority populations in biomedical research.
