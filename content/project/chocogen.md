### ABOUT
The ChocoGen research project was initiated to facilitate genetic studies of a predominantly Afro-Colombian population. The project has the joint aims of (1) characterizing the genetic ancestry of the population of Choc贸, and (2) exploring the relationship between ancestry and genetic determinants of health and disease in the region.


### RESEARCH
Researchers from the ChocoGen project are using comparative analysis of genome sequences sampled from the population of Choc贸 to characterize its patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture among ancestral populations from Africa, Europe and the Americas, and to uncover connections between genetic ancestry and population health disparities.

### PEOPLE
ChocoGen is a collaboration between the Universidad Tecnol贸gica del Choc贸 (UTCH) and a number of partner institutions in Colombia and the United States: Universidad Libre-Cali, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the PanAmerican Bioinformatics Institute (PABI).
